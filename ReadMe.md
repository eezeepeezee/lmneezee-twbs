Yet another frontend-template based on Bootstrap 5. Or framework. Or boilerplate. Whatever.

## What is LemonEezee?

LemonEezee is a frontend-template that helps quickly start projects from scratch. It provides a wide range of tasks to automate the web-developing process and has some nice functions inside to make this process more precise.

## Requirements

* [Node.js >= v.10](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp)


## Installation and quick start

Get the repo onto your local machine (or download zip):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/eezeepeezee/lmneezee-twbs.git my-awesome-project
```

Install npm packages:

```bash
$ cd my-awesome-project
$ rm -rf .git
$ npm i
```

Start working:

```bash
$ gulp watch
```


## Who may need this?

Mostly, individual developers and small teams who don't want to waste time for organizing workflow instead of doing work itself.

## What are the key ideas of LemonEezee?

1. **Lots of automated tasks not to waste your time**

   You won't forget to include your stylesheets or scripts into your page — it will be done automatically. Need a sprite of SVG icons? Just put them into one folder. Do you care about prefixes in CSS? Or correct fonts including? It is all already tuned. You will spend half an hour to know how it works and then forget about doing it by yourself.

2. **Some nice helping features**

   With Layout Helpers module you will get some nice stuff like visualizing guides and breakpoints, "mouse killer" to test your UI in keyboard-only, and a couple more cool things.

3. **All styles based on Bootstrap 5**

   No need to dive into someone's new css system. Except couple of cool things you will get to know a little bit later.

## Skills requirements

- **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **Sass**, **Vanilla JS**, a little bit of **Twig**.
- Know how to run commands in terminal and be familiar with **Node.js** and **NPM** (if you are not aware of any of those — it is worth spending couple hours on YouTube and you're one level up).

## Thanks and credits

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for being the only one css-framework to use without pain in the ass.

[Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for the great opportunity of free testing for open source projects.

There are some great third-party libraries and technologies which make LemonEezee much more better.
